```

View logs:
```bash
docker logs backend
docker logs frontend
docker logs postgres
docker logs redis
```

## 🔧 MANAGEMENT COMMANDS

### Restart Services
```bash
docker restart backend
docker restart frontend
```

### Stop All Services
```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
```

### Start All Services
```bash
docker start postgres redis backend frontend
```

### Update Application
```bash
cd /opt/solarnexus
git pull origin main
sudo ./deploy-tested.sh
```

## 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### If deployment fails:
1. Check Docker is running: `docker ps`
2. Check system resources: `df -h` and `free -m`
3. View deployment logs in real-time
4. Ensure ports 3000 and 5000 are available

### Common Issues:
- **Port conflicts**: Stop other services using ports 3000/5000
- **Disk space**: Ensure at least 2GB free space
- **Memory**: Ensure at least 2GB RAM available
- **Permissions**: Always run deployment script with `sudo`
